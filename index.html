		<p> This year, we will be holding our first TEDxBrandeis event. In the past, we have hosted
			DeisTalks, which were Brandeis TED-style talks, during the spring semester. To provide our speakers
			more opportunities to reach out to a bigger community, a bigger crowd, we successfully applied
			for a TEDx license.
			<p>Our first TEDxBrandeis event will be held on Saturday, April 22nd in Schwartz Hall, from 2PM
				to 4PM. TED Talk strictly restricts audience capacity to 100 people. Like our Facebook page and
				stay tune to the start date of ticketing. Tickets are free on a first-come, first-serve basis.

						<p class="desc"> Growing up in Germany, the USA and South Africa Hauke Ziessler became fascinated in cultural exchange and positive cooperation. Finding himself in a dichotomy of identities he began to explore cross cultural artistic exchange through his undergraduate studies in Germany and his work in Bhutan, Israel, Nepal, Ethiopia and India. Recently he began a Dual Degree Master's Program in Conflict Resolution and Coexistence Studies/Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University, where he began to explore the role of his identity in art and social transformation. Through his experiences, he gained insights into the fluidity of identity and its complexities. </p>
